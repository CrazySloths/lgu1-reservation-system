# Staff-Admin Integration Fix

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** Staff-approved bookings not showing in admin panel  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The system was using **two separate data stores**:
- **Staff Portal**: Reading/writing to `storage/app/bookings_data.json` (JSON file)
- **Admin Portal**: Reading/writing to **SQLite database** via Laravel Eloquent

When staff approved a booking:
- ✅ JSON file was updated
- ❌ Database was **NOT** updated
- Result: Admin panel showed "No Reservations Found"

---

## ✨ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Staff Approval Process** (`RequirementVerificationController`)

Now updates **BOTH** data stores when staff approves:

```php
// Update JSON file (existing)
$allBookings[$bookingIndex]['status'] = 'staff_verified';
file_put_contents($bookingsFile, json_encode($allBookings, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));

// NEW: Also update database for admin panel
$dbBooking = Booking::find($id);
if ($dbBooking) {
    $dbBooking->update([
        'staff_verified_by' => $staffId,
        'staff_verified_at' => now(),
        'staff_notes' => $request->staff_notes,
        'status' => 'pending' // Keeps it in admin's pending queue
    ]);
}
```

### 2. **Staff Rejection Process**

Same dual-update for rejections:

```php
// Update JSON file
$allBookings[$bookingIndex]['status'] = 'rejected';
file_put_contents($bookingsFile, json_encode($allBookings, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));

// Also update database
$dbBooking->update([
    'status' => 'rejected',
    'staff_notes' => $request->staff_notes,
    'rejected_reason' => $request->rejection_reason
]);
```

### 3. **Admin Panel Enhancement** (`admin/reservations/index.blade.php`)

Added visual indicator for staff-verified bookings:

- Shows **"Staff Verified"** badge with checkmark icon
- Purple color to distinguish from other statuses
- Helps admin prioritize bookings that passed staff review

---

## 📋 How It Works Now

### Staff Workflow:
1. Staff reviews documents and requirements
2. Staff approves ✅ or rejects ❌
3. System updates:
   - JSON file (`staff_verified` status)
   - Database (`pending` status for admin)
   - Both `staff_verified_by` and `staff_verified_at` timestamps

### Admin Workflow:
1. Admin sees booking in **Pending Review** tab
2. Admin sees **"Staff Verified"** badge (purple checkmark)
3. Admin knows documents were pre-checked by staff
4. Admin does final approval (creates payment slip)

---

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Data Consistency**: Both JSON and database stay in sync  
✅ **Workflow Transparency**: Admin knows which bookings staff verified  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if database update fails  
✅ **Audit Trail**: Both systems log staff verification timestamps

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
Citizen Submits Booking
         ↓
    [Database + JSON]
         ↓
  Staff Verification
         ↓
  [Database + JSON Updated]
     (status: pending + staff_verified_by)
         ↓
   Admin Panel Shows:
   • Yellow "Pending" badge
   • Purple "Staff Verified" badge
         ↓
  Admin Final Approval
         ↓
  Payment Slip Generated
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Status Mapping**:
   - JSON uses `staff_verified` status
   - Database uses `pending` status (with `staff_verified_by` field set)
   - This keeps bookings in admin's pending queue after staff verification

2. **Error Handling**:
   - If database update fails, staff process continues
   - Error is logged but doesn't block workflow
   - Admin can still manually handle via JSON file if needed

3. **Migration Path**:
   - Old bookings in JSON only: Won't appear in admin panel
   - New bookings: Will be in both systems from creation
   - Staff verification: Syncs both systems going forward
