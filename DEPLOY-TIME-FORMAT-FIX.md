# Deploy AM/PM Time Format Fix üïê

## What Was Fixed
‚úÖ Converted all booking times from **24-hour military format** (17:00:00) to **12-hour AM/PM format** (5:00 PM)

## Files Changed
1. `resources/views/reservation-status.blade.php` - My Reservations page
2. `resources/views/admin/reservations/index.blade.php` - Reservation Review page

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pull Latest Changes
```bash
cd /path/to/lgu1-reservation-system
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Clear All Caches
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
1. **Admin Portal** ‚Üí Go to "Reservation Review" page
2. Check that times show as "8:00 AM", "5:00 PM", etc. (not "08:00:00" or "17:00:00")
3. **My Reservations** page (for admin view) should also show AM/PM format
