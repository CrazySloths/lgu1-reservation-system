# Support Ticket - MySQL PDO Extension Issue

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Reference:** Previous Ticket #164866 (Resolved 19/09/2025)  
**Priority:** High - Blocking Production Deployment

## üìß SUBJECT:

**Follow-up: MySQL PDO Extension Still Not Working for PHP CLI**

---

## üìù MESSAGE TO SEND:

```
Hello Support Team,

Thank you for your previous assistance with installing PDO extensions (Ticket #164866, 
resolved on 19/09/2025). While the PDO extension was successfully installed for web 
access (phpMyAdmin works perfectly), it is still NOT enabled for PHP command-line 
interface (CLI).

CURRENT SITUATION:
I have been working around this issue by manually executing SQL migrations through 
phpMyAdmin instead of using Laravel's built-in migration system. This workaround has 
allowed me to continue development, but it's not sustainable for production deployment.

THE PROBLEM:
When running any Laravel artisan command via SSH that requires database access, I get:
"Illuminate\Database\QueryException: could not find driver (Connection: mysql)"

VERIFICATION TESTS PERFORMED:
1. SSH Command: php -m | grep -i mysql
   Result: NO OUTPUT (extension not loaded for CLI)

2. phpMyAdmin: Works perfectly ‚úì
   This confirms MySQL is running and PDO works for web requests

3. Laravel artisan commands: All fail with "could not find driver"

WHAT I NEED:
Please install/enable the MySQL PDO extension specifically for PHP CLI (command-line):

For PHP 8.4 (current version on my server):
- php8.4-mysql
- php8.4-pdo-mysql  
- php8.4-mysqlnd

AND ensure these extensions are enabled for:
1. PHP-FPM (web) - Already working ‚úì
2. PHP CLI (command-line) - Currently NOT working ‚úó

After installation, please:
1. Restart PHP-FPM service
2. Verify by running: php -m | grep -i mysql
3. Confirm output shows: mysqli, mysqlnd, pdo_mysql

SERVER DETAILS:
- Domain: facilities.local-government-unit-1-ph.com
- Server: server10.indevfinite-server.com
- PHP Version: 8.4
- Database: MySQL (faci_facility)
- User: faci15595

IMPACT:
Without PHP CLI MySQL support, I cannot:
- Run database migrations via artisan migrate
- Execute database seeders
- Use Laravel queue workers
- Run scheduled tasks (cron jobs)
- Perform proper testing and deployment

WORKAROUND CURRENTLY IN USE:
I am manually converting Laravel migrations to SQL and running them through phpMyAdmin, 
but this is time-consuming, error-prone, and not suitable for production deployment.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter as it's blocking my application from 
going live.

Thank you!
```
