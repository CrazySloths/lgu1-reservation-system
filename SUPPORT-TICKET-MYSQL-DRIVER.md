# Support Ticket - MySQL PDO Extension Issue

**Priority:** High - Blocking Production Deployment

## üìß SUBJECT:

**Follow-up: MySQL PDO Extension Still Not Working for PHP CLI**

---

## üìù MESSAGE TO SEND:

```
Hello, thank you for installing PDO in our previous ticket (#164866), and while phpMyAdmin works perfectly, the MySQL PDO extension is still not enabled for PHP CLI - when I run "php -m | grep -i mysql" via SSH, nothing appears, and Laravel artisan commands fail with "could not find driver." I've been working around this by manually running SQL migrations through phpMyAdmin, but I need the MySQL extension enabled for PHP 8.4 CLI so I can use Laravel's migration system and deploy to production. Could you please install php8.4-mysql, php8.4-pdo-mysql, and php8.4-mysqlnd for both web and CLI, then restart PHP-FPM? My domain is facilities.local-government-unit-1-ph.com on server10. Thank you!
```
